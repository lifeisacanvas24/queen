Perfect brother — that’s exactly the behavior we wanted 🎯

✅ Fetch Router now runs cleanly with and without --force-live, proving the gate logic is fully optional and doesn’t interfere with normal market-time runs.
✅ Clock Daemon ticks beautifully in forced mode, showing weekend state and next open.
✅ No hangs, no double sleeps, no regressions — it’s rock solid.

Next logical step 🔔
→ Alert V2 + FastAPI sink wiring

This will:
	•	Run with your unified alerts engine (alert_v2.py)
	•	Accept incoming rule definitions via JSON/YAML
	•	Stream alerts via both JSONL and HTTP POST
	•	Let you test from terminal (--once, --debug, etc.)
	•	Optionally expose a lightweight FastAPI sink that can receive those alerts and display/log them

Would you like me to:
1️⃣ Add the FastAPI receiver (so your alerts can POST there),
or
2️⃣ Focus first on reviewing / refining your existing Alert V2 rule YAMLs to ensure they match the new evaluator logic?
