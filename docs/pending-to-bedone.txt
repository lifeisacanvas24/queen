Beautifully gathered, brother 👑 — here’s a clean, consolidated and prioritized TODO roadmap that merges everything you’ve discussed (settings, market, daemons, and tactical regime systems) into one coherent execution plan.

⸻

🧭 QUEEN PROJECT — CONSOLIDATED TODO ROADMAP

⚙️ 1. Environment & Settings System

✅ Current
	•	You already have:
	•	queen/settings.py — base config
	•	queen/helpers/settings_proxy.py — dot-access wrapper (SETTINGS.brokers.UPSTOX.API_SCHEMA)
	•	Environment switcher CLI:

python -m queen.cli.env_switch prod



🧩 Next Steps
	•	Integrate proxy globally
→ So from queen.settings import SETTINGS gives dot-access automatically (not raw dict).
	•	Daemon-safe reloading (optional)
→ Add auto-refresh to settings_proxy that detects config file updates and reloads _data without restart.
🔹 Outcome: live settings reload for all daemons, no restart required.
	•	Add environment awareness
→ Let each daemon automatically detect its current environment (dev, staging, prod) and pick configs accordingly.

⸻

💹 2. Market System Enhancements

✅ Current
	•	Full async market subsystem:
	•	queen/helpers/market.py → Pure, timezone-aware logic
	•	MarketClock class → central heartbeat
	•	CLI Playback simulator (market_playback.py)
	•	Flags: --date, --speed, --fast, --force-live, --no-clock

🧩 Next Steps
	•	Add clock_daemon.py
	•	A standalone executable daemon:
	•	Runs MarketClock in background
	•	Publishes ticks via asyncio queues
	•	Logs ticks + sessions
	•	Provides small REST/status API (optional)
	•	CLI:

python -m queen.daemons.clock_daemon --interval 1 --log --debug


	•	Market Dashboard Mode (v2.0)
	•	Build real-time console dashboard using rich.live:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🕒 Time: 09:17 | Session: REGULAR        │
│ GATE: LIVE / WORKING | 📈 Market LIVE     │
│ Next Candle: 09:20:00 | Ticks: 36        │
│ Legend: 🟥 HOLIDAY 🟨 PRE 🟩 LIVE 🩵 POST │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘


	•	Integrate MarketClock + playback in real-time.
	•	CLI flag: --dashboard

	•	Optional future extensions
	•	Add --date and --speed to clock daemon for simulated replays.
	•	Add Polars → Matplotlib visualization (session timeline).
	•	Add weekend/holiday injection tests.
	•	Add hot-reload toggle for live strategy daemon sync.

⸻

🧠 3. Regime Layer (Adaptive Intelligence)

✅ Context
	•	You’ve mentioned regimes.json and tactical blending models like:
	•	RScore / VolX / LBX / Momentum composites

🧩 Next Steps
	•	Create queen/helpers/tactical_regime_adapter.py
	•	Reads regimes.json (trend/vol regime definitions)
	•	Adjusts tactical blend weights dynamically
	•	E.g.:

adapter = TacticalRegimeAdapter(regime="Volatile")
weights = adapter.adjust({"RScore": 0.5, "VolX": 0.3, "LBX": 0.2})


	•	Integrates seamlessly with model runners.
🔹 Outcome: Your fusion models self-adapt to market mood.

	•	Add regime-aware visualization
	•	Regime timeline panel in Rich dashboard (color-coded background by regime type)

⸻

🧩 4. Integration Goals

Once the above is implemented:
	•	All daemons (fetchers, aggregators, model runners) subscribe to one shared MarketClock tick feed.
	•	All components pull configs via the same SETTINGS proxy (auto-reloading).
	•	Tactical models adjust dynamically via regime adapters.
	•	Playback mode allows full day simulation for QA.
	•	Dashboard mode visualizes everything in real time — a mini trading terminal.

⸻

🔮 Bonus (Long-Term)

Goal	Description
🧱 daemon_registry.json	Global process registry (names, ports, PIDs, last heartbeat).
🔌 socket/IPC bridge	Allow daemons to broadcast MarketClock ticks to others (ZMQ / websockets).
📊 market_timeline_plotter.py	Render full market session timeline + tick density charts using Matplotlib.
⚡ Hot Reload System	Automatic reload of settings, instruments, and holiday calendars without restarts.
🧠 Regime-aware strategy router	Route trading logic dynamically to different models depending on active regime.


⸻

🧭 Recommended Next Step (for Today)

→ Step 1: Integrate settings_proxy into global queen.settings
So that from queen.settings import SETTINGS instantly gives you DotDict-based access everywhere.

Then:
→ Step 2: Implement clock_daemon.py
A simple executable that continuously emits ticks, logs state, and can later be extended to a dashboard.

⸻

Would you like me to start by drafting the clock_daemon.py (v1.0), brother —
so you can launch a live market heartbeat from terminal like:

python -m queen.daemons.clock_daemon --interval 1 --force-live

and have it publish colored tick logs continuously?


========

Perfect brother 👑 — that’s exactly the mindset of a system architect:
keep each layer self-contained, logged, and traceable.

Here’s how we’ll log this as an official To-Do Item for our roadmap document (so we always know what’s complete, in progress, or deferred):

⸻

🧾 Queen Quant Roadmap — Active TODOs

✅ 1. Market Clock Daemon (v1.1)

Goal:
Stabilize and extend queen.daemons.clock_daemon for continuous async ticks with lightweight file logging.

Tasks:
	•	Integrate Force-Live mode fix (disable auto_pause).
	•	Add tick JSONL logging via --log-file /path/to/ticks.jsonl.
	•	Append one structured JSON line per tick (timestamp, gate, session, is_open).
	•	Display runtime summary (ticks, uptime).
	•	Keep daemon self-contained (no aiohttp yet).

Deliverable:
clock_daemon.py v1.1
A production-ready heartbeat daemon for internal scheduling and testing.

⸻

🕓 Next Milestone (Step 2 — Config & Regime Integration)

⚙️ settings_proxy integration

Goal:
Auto-wrap the global settings dict with DotDict for seamless dot-access throughout the stack.

Tasks:
	•	Patch queen/settings/__init__.py so from queen.settings import SETTINGS returns a DotDict.
	•	Confirm read-only behavior for safety.
	•	Optional: future hot-reload support for live daemons.

⸻

📈 tactical_regime_adapter (future layer)

Goal:
Adaptive tactical weighting helper based on regime conditions (volatility/trend mix).

Tasks:
	•	Implement tactical_regime_adapter.py.
	•	Parse regimes.json and compute blend ratios.
	•	Expose unified adjust_tactical_weights() API for model runners.

⸻

📊 Status

Item	Owner	Status	Target
Market Clock v1.1	🟢 Active	🚧 In Progress	Today
settings_proxy integration	🔵 Queued	⏳ Pending	Next
tactical_regime_adapter	⚪ Planned	🔮 Later	After settings proxy
===========

Perfectly said, brother 👑 — and yes, that’s the precise logical flow we should build around.
Let’s confirm the full Queen Universe Hierarchy (Final v1.0) exactly as you just outlined:

⸻

🧭 Queen Instrument Universe — Hierarchical Flow (v1.0 Final)

ALL_SYMBOLS
   ↓
MONTHLY_INSTRUMENTS
   ↓
WEEKLY_INSTRUMENTS
   ↓
INTRADAY_INSTRUMENTS
   └──→ PORTFOLIO (independent branch)


⸻

💡 Explanation of Each Layer

Stage	File	Source	Purpose	Refresh	Notes
1️⃣ ALL_SYMBOLS	all_symbols.json	Unified NSE + BSE merged list	Full clean symbol master with ISIN + listing_date	Weekly	Root of everything — no exclusions beyond junk filters
2️⃣ MONTHLY_INSTRUMENTS	monthly_instruments.json	Derived from all_symbols	Broad monthly focus — large caps, movers, fundamental setups	Monthly	Feeds weekly/swing lists
3️⃣ WEEKLY_INSTRUMENTS	weekly_instruments.json	Derived from monthly	Tactical, rotation-based shortlists (momentum/sectoral)	Weekly	Used for swing fetchers
4️⃣ INTRADAY_INSTRUMENTS	intraday_instruments.json	Derived from weekly	High-vol + liquid instruments for live algo trading	Daily	Auto-updated by scanner
5️⃣ PORTFOLIO	portfolio_instruments.json	Curated manually	Long-term holds, multi-baggers, or watchlist	Manual	Not derived — can overlap with others


⸻

🧩 Design Principles

✅ Single Source of Truth:
Every downstream file is derived from all_symbols.json.

✅ Progressive Refinement:
Each subsequent layer reduces scope based on liquidity, volatility, fundamentals, or strategy filters.

✅ Portfolio Independence:
PORTFOLIO is not dependent on any trading layer. It can include IPOs, future stars, or long-hold plays even if they don’t appear in monthly/weekly files.

✅ Listing-Date Integrity:
listing_date flows through every layer → used to avoid pre-IPO fetch errors.

✅ Config-Driven Placement:
Each file path comes directly from SETTINGS.EXCHANGE["EXCHANGES"]["NSE_BSE"]["INSTRUMENTS"]
— ensuring the same structure for NSE_BSE, MCX, or future exchanges.

⸻

⚙️ Next Step Proposal

Now that your flow is finalized, here’s what we’ll build next:

🏗️ queen/helpers/universe_builder.py (v1.0)

Purpose: Automate generation of all universe layers progressively.

Capabilities:
	•	Loads all_nse_equity_list.csv + all_bse_equity_list.csv
	•	Merges → deduplicated all_symbols.json
	•	Generates monthly, weekly, and intraday subsets using:
	•	Listing age
	•	Liquidity thresholds (e.g., top 500 by volume)
	•	Volatility / momentum filters (optional placeholder)
	•	Preserves listing_date
	•	Writes outputs into queen/data/static/ or runtime/universe/
	•	Optionally logs summary panels via Rich (counts, new additions, delistings)

CLI Examples:

python -m queen.helpers.universe_builder --refresh all
python -m queen.helpers.universe_builder --build monthly
python -m queen.helpers.universe_builder --summary


⸻

Would you like me to go ahead and generate this universe_builder.py (v1.0)
so your entire instrument funnel can be auto-built and maintained cleanly, brother?


👉 Keep it at top-level: queen/scheduler.py

Here’s why:
	1.	✅ It’s a runtime component, not a helper.
	2.	✅ It already has a CLI entry interface (run_cli()).
	3.	✅ It orchestrates helpers — not the other way around.
	4.	✅ You’ll likely add other daemons soon (e.g. queen/analyzer.py, queen/signal_watcher.py),
and they’ll all live at the same “runtime root” level.


 Next Steps (if you’d like)

After this, we can add:
	1.	scheduler_jobs.py — job registry (alerts, syncers, analytics)
	2.	scheduler_dashboard.py — async dashboard UI (optional)
	3.	rate_limiter.py integration for adaptive pacing

⸻

Would you like me to go ahead and generate scheduler_jobs.py v1.0 (Job Registry + Async Hooks) next,
so that your scheduler can register multiple async tasks — not just fetch_router — in a modular way?
