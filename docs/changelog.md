### üîñ How to Update This File

Each time you prepare a new release:

1. Update this file under `[Unreleased]` with the changes.
2. When tagging (e.g., `v0.2.0`), move those entries to a new section:

   ```markdown
   ## [v0.2.0] ‚Äî YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added

   - ...

   ### Changed

   - ...

   3. Commit and push both the tag and updated changelog:
   ```

git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: update changelog for v0.2.0"
git push
git push origin v0.2.0

‚∏ª

‚ÄúA mindful changelog keeps your evolution transparent and traceable.‚Äù üåø
EOF

---

## ‚úÖ Commit & Push

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: add CHANGELOG template (Keep a Changelog + SemVer)"
git push


‚∏ª

Once pushed, you‚Äôll see it beautifully rendered at the top of your GitHub repo ‚Äî it‚Äôll become your official release history page for Queen.

Would you like me to generate a small automation snippet (GitHub Action) that automatically bumps the date in CHANGELOG.md and commits it whenever you tag a new version (so you never forget)?
